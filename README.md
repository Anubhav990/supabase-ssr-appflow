# supabase-ssr-appflow
A lightweight Next.js + Supabase SSR boilerplate built for secure server-side authentication and user management (replacement for deprecated auth-helpers). Implements server-rendered sessions, role-based access control, CSRF mitigation, and common auth flows (signup, signin, magic links, OAuth) so you can ship a safe web app fast.
